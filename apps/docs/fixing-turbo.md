GitHub Copilot: I can see that you're trying to run `pnpm dev` but it's failing because turbo isn't installed. Let me help you fix this issue.

The error is showing that the 'turbo' command isn't recognized, which means Turborepo isn't installed properly in your project. Let's install it and fix the issue.

First, let's install turbo as a development dependency: I see, we need to specify the `-w` flag since this is a workspace root package. Let's try again: Now let's update the package.json file to use the local turbo executable instead of relying on a global installation. I'll modify the scripts in your root package.json: Now let's try running the dev command again: I see the issue now. Turbo 2.0 and newer has renamed the `pipeline` field in the turbo.json file to `tasks`. Let's update the turbo.json file: Let's update the turbo.json file to use `tasks` instead of `pipeline`: 
```


Made changes.

Now let's try running the dev command again: The API service started successfully, but we're encountering an issue with the web app. It seems there might be a problem with the Next.js installation in the web project. Let's check the package.json file in the web directory and make sure the required dependencies are installed: The issue is related to Next.js not being properly installed in the web project. Let's fix this by installing the Next.js package for the web app: Now let's try modifying the web dev script to not use Turbopack, as it seems to be causing issues: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's try running the dev command again: Great! Both the API and web services are now running successfully. The turbo command is working correctly after installing it as a dependency and updating the turbo.json file from `pipeline` to `tasks`.

Here's a summary of what we fixed:

1. We installed Turbo (turbo) as a development dependency at the root level using `pnpm add -Dw turbo`
2. We updated the turbo.json file to use the newer `tasks` field instead of the outdated `pipeline` field (this was required for turbo v2.0+)
3. We fixed the web app by ensuring Next.js was properly installed
4. We modified the web app's dev script to use standard mode instead of Turbopack, which was causing issues

Now your monorepo is set up correctly, and you can run `pnpm dev` to start both the API server and the Next.js web application simultaneously. The API is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and the web app is running on http://localhost:3000.
